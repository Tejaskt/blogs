### 👋 Introduction

As an Android developer currently diving deep into Jetpack Compose, I’ve decided to document my learning journey - not just to help myself revise, but also to help others who are starting out. This is the first post in a series where I’ll share what I learn while exploring [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), the modern toolkit for building native UIs in Android.

---

### 🧠 What is Jetpack Compose?

Jetpack Compose is Android’s recommended way to build UI. Unlike the traditional XML approach, Compose lets you build UI using **Kotlin code** directly. It’s declarative, reactive, and very developer-friendly.

With Compose, we no longer need to define UI layouts separately in XML files. Instead, we describe the UI in composable functions - the UI updates automatically when the state changes.

### 🛠️ Setting Up Jetpack Compose

To start working with Jetpack Compose, I created a new project in Android Studio **Giraffe or above**, and selected the **“Empty Compose Activity”** template.

Here are the dependencies added by default:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.8.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.5.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material3:material3:1.2.0"
    implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.6.1"
}
```

⚠️ Make sure you’re using at least **Kotlin 1.9.0+** and the **latest stable version of Compose**.

### 💡 My First Composable Function

The first function I created was a basic `Greeting` message:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Text(text = "Hello, $name!")
}
```

Then, I used it inside the `MainActivity.kt` like this:

```kotlin
setContent {
    MaterialTheme {
        Greeting("Tejas")
    }
}
```

This was a game-changer moment for me — writing UI directly in Kotlin is way smoother and more fun than XML!

### 🔍 Previewing the UI

Jetpack Compose supports live previews in Android Studio. Just add a `@Preview` annotation to your composable like this:

```kotlin
@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun GreetingPreview() {
    Greeting("Jetpack Compose")
}
```

This feature helped me see UI changes without running the app on an emulator or physical device. It’s a huge time saver during development.

### 📝 What I Learned

* Composables are the building blocks of Jetpack Compose.
    
* You can easily preview UI using `@Preview`.
    
* The Compose setup is beginner-friendly, especially with Android Studio templates.
    
* Learning through official [Android training](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial) was very helpful.

### 📚 What's Next?

In my next post, I’ll dive into:

* State and recomposition
    
* Layouts like `Column`, `Row`, `Box`
    
* Material Design 3 with Compose
    

If you’re also learning Compose, feel free to follow along or share your experiences!
