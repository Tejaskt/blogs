## ✨ Introduction

One of the biggest mindset shifts when moving from traditional XML-based Android UI to **Jetpack Compose** is how we manage state and UI updates. In the **Compose world**, we no longer tell the UI *how* to update — we just say *what* we want it to be, and Compose handles the rest!

In this post, we’ll explore:

* Why managing **state** is key in Jetpack Compose
    
* The difference between XML and Compose in handling UI updates
    
* Practical ways to **maintain state** using `mutableStateOf`, `remember`, and `rememberSaveable`

## 🧠 From XML to Compose: What Instead of How

In XML-based UI, when a user interacted with the app (like selecting an item or rotating the phone), you had to manually update the UI — write logic to remember the user's action and redraw the screen accordingly.

But with Jetpack Compose, you shift your focus to **declaring the UI based on state**. Compose automatically **recomposes** the UI when that state changes.

### 📱 Example:

If a user selects an answer and rotates the screen:

* **In XML:** You need to manually save the selected answer and restore it.
    
* **In Compose:** You just maintain the right state variable, and Compose will **recompose** the UI automatically!
    

That’s why in Compose, we don’t **control the UI flow** — we just **define what the UI should look like** for a given state.

## 🔄 How to Change the UI and Maintain the State?

Let’s walk through the three main approaches to maintaining state in Jetpack Compose — with pros and cons.

---

### 🧪 1. Basic State with `mutableStateOf()`

```kotlin
var varname: MutableState<YourType?> = mutableStateOf(null)
varname.value = parameter
```

✅ **Pros**:

* Lets you update the UI based on user interactions.
    

❌ **Cons**:

* Will **not survive recompositions** — meaning the state might reset unexpectedly.
    

---

### 🧠 2. Remembering State with `remember {}`

```kotlin
var varname: MutableState<YourType?> = remember { mutableStateOf(null) }
```

✅ **Pros**:

* Keeps your state even when recomposition happens.
    

❌ **Cons**:

* Doesn't survive **configuration changes** like screen rotation.
    

---

### 💾 3. Save State Across Configuration Changes with `rememberSaveable`

```kotlin
var varname: YourType? by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(null) }
```

✅ **Pros**:

* Survives both **recompositions** and **configuration changes**.
    
* Cleaner syntax with `by` keyword — no more `.value` access needed!
    

```kotlin
ElevatedButton(onClick = { expanded = !expanded }){
   // Text(if (expanded.value) "Show less" else "Show more") // no need to access the var with .value
      Text(if (expanded) "Show less" else "Show more")  // you can directly access it.
}
```

⚡ With `rememberSaveable`, Compose will automatically **restore your state** even after rotation. Ideal for quiz apps, forms, and interactive UI!

## 🏁 Conclusion

State management in Jetpack Compose is not just a feature — it's **the foundation** of building reactive, modern UIs. Instead of managing every UI change manually like in XML, Compose **reacts** to your state changes.

To recap:

* Use `mutableStateOf()` for quick UI interactions.
    
* Wrap it in `remember {}` to survive recompositions.
    
* Use `rememberSaveable` to persist state across configuration changes.
